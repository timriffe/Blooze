sooo abstract.

\section{Background}
The casual observer may be tempted to judge whether or not a population is
longevous by looking at its age pyramid, perhaps taking the proportion of
the population that are centenarians as a measure of how long-lived a population
is. Demographers know better than to trust population stocks for such things,
having established since the 18th Century \citep{graunt1939natural} the
lifetable--- purged of the capricious movements of population stocks--- as the primary instrument to assess
longevity. It is our aim to point out that even under the most ideal of
hypothetical circumstances ---a population closed to migration, renewing with
identically-sized birth cohorts and unchanging mortality rates--- the proportion
of centenarians is so highly variable that is must be understood as unreliable
for the purpousness of measuring the propensity of a population to be
long-lived.

\section{Methods}

We simulate stuff.

\section{Lesson}
Stick to the lifetable folks.
